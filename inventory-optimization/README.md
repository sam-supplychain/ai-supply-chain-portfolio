Inventory optimization balances service level targets with cost and risk. It defines the right stock levels at the right locations to meet demand while minimizing capital and storage costs.

## Key Concepts
- Safety stock and reorder points
- Lead time variability
- Multi-echelon inventory (MEIO)
- ABC classification and SKU rationalization

## Business Decisions Supported
- Safety stock policies
- Reorder frequency and lot sizes
- Deployment strategies across network
- Inventory vs service tradeoffs

## Expected Outcomes
- Reduced excess inventory
- Better cash-to-cash cycle
- Higher OTIF (On-Time In-Full) performance
